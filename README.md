## Project Overview
With this project, I wanted to explore and learn Shiny For Python's in terms of data analysis capabilities.
I chose a comparison of the weather in Poland in 2022 as the topic of the project. This was inspired by many conflicting observations about the seasons.
## Current Status
This is just an early alpha version. I have a lot of things to improve, modify and implement.

Whole project and data was not properly tested.
